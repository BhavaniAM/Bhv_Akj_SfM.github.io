# Image Matching: Structure from Motion

## Problem Statement:
The goal of the problem is to reconstruct a 3D model of the object from the various 2D images taken from different viewpoints. The images are taken in different lighting conditions over a period of time and constitute of different angles of the object. 

## Solution:
Refer to https://bhavaniam.github.io/imc_sfm.github.io/ to get a complete rundown of the solution and the approach taken. 

## Using the code:
The code can be run on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/bhavaniam/imc-2024-sfm) by making a copy of the notebook and editing/running it. Further, the modular form of the code can be found in the directories in this repository.
